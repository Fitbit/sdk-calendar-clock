Fitbit SDK example application which demonstrates the Companion Calendar API.

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

The companion fetches calendar data using the Companion Calendar API and sends it to the
device using the File Transfer API. The application decides which event to display.

> Note: Only a subset of the calendar data is sent to the device, if you need to
> use different fields, then you need to include them in the file transfer.
